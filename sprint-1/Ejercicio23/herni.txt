- The keys of this excercise is to put the container that contains the modal, under the principal div, whith a width and heght of the viewport, with a position absolute, left = 0 and top = 0, and dinamically put the filter: blur(5px); to the div that contains the modal. So when the display: none of that div is taken, and the blur is activated, it looks like the blur is in the first div, but it is on the div that contains the modal.
